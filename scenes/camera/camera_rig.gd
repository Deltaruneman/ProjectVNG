class_name CameraRig
extends Node3D

## Camera that follows the character.
##
## The rig is the parent node, `Camera3D` is a child with a fixed offset. The rig moves with the
## character while the camera keeps a fixed angle, so the frame never rotates or tilts with the
## character.
##
## Why the camera is no longer a child of Player: as a child, the camera would copy **1:1** every
## movement, including jumps — the whole world would bob with each jump. A rig that follows with
## lag and a clamp fixes that.

## The character to follow. Assign it in the Inspector (drag the Player node in).
@export var target: Node3D

## Convergence speed. Higher makes the camera hug the target more tightly; lower makes it lag and
## smooth more.

## The camera never lags the character by more than this many meters vertically.

## The camera's position relative to the rig, the point it looks at, and the lens field of view.
